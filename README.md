This repo talks about 
1.  the python language and built-in types
2.  The standard library
3.  becoming an expert pythone developer
4.  idiomatic python

## Idiomatic Python
The Zen of python is written by tim peters, set of things which helps us to write better python language

1. Beautiful is better than ugly.
2. Explicit is better than implicit.
3. Simple is better than complex.
4. Complex is better than complicated.
5. Flat is better than nested.
6. Sparse is better than dense.
7. Readability counts.
8. Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
9. Although practicality beats purity.
10. Errors should never pass silently.
11. Unless explicitly silenced.
12. In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
13. There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
14. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
15. Now is better than never.
16. Although never is often better than *right* now.
17. If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
18. If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
19. Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Thie repo will have 
1. Python's type hierarchy
2. variables
3. conditionals
4. functions
5. loops
6. break, contnue and try
7. classes

This is an intermediate to advanced Python course.

To have the full benefit of this course you should be comfortable with the basic Python language including:

variables and simple types such as str , bool , int  and float  types
for  and while  loops
if...else...  statements
defining functions (using the def  statement)
writing simple classes using the class  keyword and the __init__  function
using simple lists , tuples , dictionaries  and sets
